# Release Build Issues - Fixes Applied

## Issues Identified

### 1. Unsafe `firstWhere` Calls
**Problem**: Multiple `firstWhere` calls without `orElse` parameters were causing `StateError` exceptions in release builds when items weren't found.

**Locations Fixed**:
- `lib/presentation/blocs/subscription_provider.dart` - All subscription operation methods
- Added proper error handling with `orElse` parameters

**Fix Applied**:
```dart
// Before (unsafe)
final subscription = _subscriptions.firstWhere((s) => s.id == id);

// After (safe)
final subscription = _subscriptions.firstWhere(
  (s) => s.id == id,
  orElse: () => throw Exception('Subscription not found'),
);
```

### 2. Missing Action Handlers in Home Screen
**Problem**: SubscriptionCard was missing action handlers (`onPause`, `onResume`, `onCancel`, `onMarkAsPaid`) causing cards to be greyed out.

**Locations Fixed**:
- `lib/presentation/screens/home_screen.dart`
- Added all missing action handlers with proper implementations

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `_pauseSubscription()`, `_resumeSubscription()`, `_cancelSubscription()`, `_markSubscriptionAsPaid()` methods
- Connected them to the SubscriptionCard widget

### 3. ListView Rendering Issues
**Problem**: Missing unique keys for ListView items could cause rendering problems in release builds.

**Locations Fixed**:
- `lib/presentation/screens/home_screen.dart`
- Added unique keys for both Padding wrapper and SubscriptionCard

**Fix Applied**:
```dart
return Padding(
  key: ValueKey('subscription_item_${subscription.id}'),
  child: SubscriptionCard(
    key: ValueKey('subscription_card_${subscription.id}'),
    // ...
  ),
);
```

### 4. AppTip Widget Safety Issues
**Problem**: Potential null safety and timing issues in the AppTip overlay widget.

**Locations Fixed**:
- `lib/core/widgets/app_tip.dart`
- Added proper null checks and mounted state validation
- Improved positioning calculations

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `if (!mounted) return;` guards
- Added null checks for RenderBox
- Added screen size validation
- Used `math.min` instead of custom min function

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Clean Build Process
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build apk --release
```

### 2. Test Scenarios
1. **Add Multiple Subscriptions**: Test adding several subscriptions in sequence
2. **Swipe Actions**: Test all swipe actions (pause, resume, cancel, edit, delete, mark as paid)
3. **List Scrolling**: Test smooth scrolling through the subscription list
4. **Card Interactions**: Ensure all cards are fully interactive and not greyed out

### 3. Key Areas to Verify
- [ ] All subscription cards are fully interactive (not greyed out)
- [ ] Can add multiple subscriptions without issues
- [ ] Swipe actions work correctly
- [ ] No infinite scrolling behavior
- [ ] Proper error handling when operations fail

## Notes
- All fixes maintain backward compatibility
- Error handling is now more robust for release builds
- The app should behave identically between debug and release builds
